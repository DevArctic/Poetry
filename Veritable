milieu of rasping mouths crying please
Blood bubbles up the mouth and seeps
Trickles drips on down the cheeks
Clean. Mr. Clean.
Shot jacket brass action lead
Reds! Seeing red.
The shrugging dead.
What to do instead
Blame the head
Lies get fed
And said
Predictable shouts of eager teeth
Wrinkles ironed out for camel meat
Please Mr. president the parents bleat
Back down the gullet, back under the sheet
