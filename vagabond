 who stumbles soft
Along the brick and cobble paths in darkness
And hearing voices laugh so far behind
Who know of all my sins, who know of me
From rumor’s bloody hands and lies of ease,
To shame my will and constitution. Shame!
But what am I discussing? Sense is lost
And in my mind is ache and worried pain.
Some rest is all I need, recovery,
For now the time is late and buses run
At times most inconvenient for my needs.
It will be hours before the next one comes.
With miles to go, I can’t entrust my legs
To make the distance. So, what now, drunk oaf?
Of all the times to need to think things through
How you have dimmed your brain with vaporous ale!
I stood there on the corner block of clay
As cars with young and rising stars fly past.
The beats of music played in stark reminder
Of all the miles I’d come. Alone, alone.
No friend to bail me out, no comfort dog,
No one to worry if I’d died tonight.
That’s freedom, friend, although I’d sell it then
For soft clean sheets and quiet nights, or less,
A peace that has eluded me since youth.
This roil-some life is punishment enough.
But Ha! What’s this? A church I’d never seen.
Conversion’s not what I intend, my friend,
Behind the church is heaps of dirt and stone,
Piled high along the side of a small wood shed
The perfect spot for me tonight, I think
I checked the line of sight, indeed, it’s hidden
Sleep here I will! For some few hours, of course,
Until the buses run again, I’ll rest.
I snuggled down into a pit of loam
And layered leaves, debris, and sticks in lieu
Of blankets warm and loving. This was safe.
And hidden there I felt as if a spy
Or other clandestine soldier, camouflaged,
I hid from all, and how I wished I might
Remain in hiding, perpetually silent, veiled
Invisible to life, forever dead.
And soon, my thoughts on death, I fell asleep.
