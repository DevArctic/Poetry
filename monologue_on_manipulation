My greatest trick involves no decks of cards,
But simply baring neck to humid rooms,
Expose the jugular and all the veins,
And lie in naked pose, for all to see,
Who gnash and drift before a chance reveals
The empty thought of violence stays the mind,
And lifts the brother human forward once,
With guilt and shame himself incepted, fly
And cackle, seeing more of goodness there,
Than any blissful soul did dare to dream,
And sifting primes by ones and twos and threes
Before a crash destroys the window blinds.
