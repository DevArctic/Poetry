the fragrance of the Beats exudes from me
hum drum and oily skin out on the prowl
for famished want of grim attentive souls
to bleat on words like addicted French auteurs
or snaps on stage and off, the heat of day
makes wholesome all the primitive delights
of beer and coffee, tasty cigarettes
who kill for killings' sake, our moods align
on solitary reminiscences
in which the harbored grudge dis-plays intent;
plight of a dirty hobo singing the blues
d'you see that movie made for Dylan's pride?
in which he claims his childhood was a match
to a homeless drifting black and Southern boy
who climbs aboard a boxcar day by day
and talks as if the Lord had struck him dumb
with half-believin' Southward turns of phrase
no never heard no nonsense drip out these mouths
sick as a terrible actor, Praise the Lord;
inhaling toxic fumes is well enough,
but self-destruction bears a meager sum,
a dowry not inhibited by thought
or rationed care, they gave me cigarettes
down there, inside the hospital's crescendo,
where all did stomp and puff and wander left
of center, ever drifting, pointless, free,
confined, and lacking basic hygiene, asking
for scraps of shredded leaves infused with tar
you might begin to think I disapprove,
but cigarettes are comforts to the mad
who lack the strength to overcome an itch
when every hall they walk encircles them;
the coffeeshop sits square along the main
and wooden doors invite the den of words
where rain might trap a man in deadly beans;
