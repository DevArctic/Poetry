Return, my eyes, to what was once your gaze,
Who rolled encased in darkness, terrified,
That all they'd seen might be forgotten blurs.
O, how I wish it were so easy, friend.
I grew too large for sunken ships in bottles
Too greedy for the coins in public fountains
And altogether unprepared for what
Awaits an ego built on glass foundations.
I blame the town that razed a farmer's home
To better serve encroaching parent crowds
Demanding roads and bridges, shops and havens,
To salt the Earth in fervent worship of commerce.
I sound alike to hipster communists but
All round us reeks of money winds and gas
Who can escape the drawn casino promise?
Not I, the prophet made in madness, no.
There is no transcendental path to tread
That still believes in things like I believed.
Poor me! How dumb and low my jaw did hang,
How small and innocent my features loomed!
It can't be helped. I peer at past mistakes
Just as a child peers through aquarium glass.
How slow majestic rays do glide along!
