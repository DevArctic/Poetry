Well, I for one believe absurdity 
Is such a thing that all who do are stuck 
To run in circles round a wheel like mice. 
The purest mice of all are miners, yes, 
Whose uselessness, apparent as the sun, 
Breathes honest air and shines in stark relief 
Compared to all who shout from roofs and halls 
Who dream of big tomorrows, idyllic scenes, 
And Edens, which we know are futile ground. 
To live, to die, to suck electric teats.
