The turning of a wheel, a spiral sign
A cross so bent around an axis, lo!
A silly little thing imbued with what?
The deaths of millions? No, absurd to think
That anything could be so toxic, ill
Or good, a symbol's worth is in the minds
Of those who see, perceive, or more, create
Its meaning. I, enlightened, see it not.
'Tis nothing more than marks on whitened brick.
