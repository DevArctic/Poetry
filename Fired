The man, with rage along his eyebrows said,
What's this? The others have reported you,
Tell tales that you've been cursing them for what?
Because they tried to help? What's wrong with you?
You can't deride coworkers in such ways!
'Fuck off?!?' What brought you here to say this grime?
Have you no sense of decency or shame?
Explain yourself, and I'll consider it.
And I to him, What noise is this you make?
What matter it? 'Fuck' here or there, who cares?
Have you not seen true violence in your life?
Admit I will, I said those words to them,
And I'll say more before this day is done.
Your tone does not make me afraid, through Hell
I've been, and you come forth with moral lies
Like I can not see through this pious stance!
Do what you will, I have no use for you.
And he, You're done, pack up your things, begone.
