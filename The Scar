The scar! This blasted horrid scar of mine.
Now, I have borne so many scars in time,
Some of my own device, in burning skin,
I wrote the tragedy of life in circles,
But none so ugly as this, Just gaze at it!
Underneath nose and crossing to my lip.
Just look at it! Its white grown tissue stares,
So bright and never growing hair again,
It ruins the line of my mustache and more,
Reminds me every day of that long night.
For I am cursed. I have been cursed by Them,
That man has sentenced me to putrid life!
Begone, you ugly thing! Dismissed, now go.
He asked me if I might go in to see
About corrective surgery, today
The surgeon’s skill is quite alright. You think?
Seeing as how it bothers you in life.
Began to laugh, I did. To what an end?
To cover up atrocities like me?
Can I be called an honest man if I
Begin to hide my scars, my words, my deeds.
Look to my arms. Should hide away those scars?
The tops of my feet. Should cover them with gauze?
And which of these is loved and pitied most?
Would women fawn at these just as they might
The kinds unearthed from fights, attacks, and combat?
I fought a war, unseen, without support,
Though I expect you won’t relate to this.
I think I like the scar, might love the scar,
Between my hating it I proudly preen
And shave so it is visibly pronounced.
I’ve felt true freedom only once, my friend
Face-down, I made a bloody pile of rot.
There is no way. Can not get rid of it.
Would be a getting rid of me, myself.
And that I won’t do.
