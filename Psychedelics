I raved and rattled, there, in muttered words,
My ass upon the kitchen floor, in sum
Or substance, talking to a ghost of life
And getting nowhere, laughing out at Them
Who watched me toil, conducting dialogues,
And hearing arguments to some vague train
Of thought concerning all it might concern,
To Life, the Universe, and Ev’rything,
‘Cause I would soon know all there is to know
If I may speak outside the narrative,
To you directly, friend, I must admit
That memory eludes me here and there,
The story can’t be well recovered now
But those who saw or heard relayed some bits
And I remember far too little else
To really get across events or shames…
I must have stayed in place for some lost time,
Because, now sober, I have learned the gist
Of it, and brilliant not these thoughts of mine,
Which border myth, religious fervor, zen
And all the noise of cleromancy’s draw…
What I had gleaned from chats with demon fiends
Was life begins again just after death,
Reborn, a man is placed right where he was.
His parents, circumstances, and all the rest
Remain the same, it seems to be the same,
But no, the truth of things belies a change
Some minor thing, the spin of particles
Perhaps, locations moved a tiny jaunt
The scale of Planck, a miniscule amount
But ah, once dead, reborn again, re-change
All lives outstretch in infinite vast space
All possibilities of life are laid,
Now I will have to live them. Oh! Despair!
For every life of hedonistic sin,
For every pleasure, pain awaits as well.
Infinite lives where Emma Watson learns
The joy of blowjobs at my feet, alas
Infinite lives in which my execution
By way of crucifixion broadcasts live
To classrooms ‘round the nation! Horror! Death!
