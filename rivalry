Supine, the boy mouthed words or curses low,
But not responses to the paramedic,
Who asked the boy, his gaping fish expression,
How much you had to drink, tonight? Hello?
You! Tell me what his name is! Friends, so-called,
Who looked upon the scene detached and bored,
We think it’s Troy, they said, Though we know not.
Just met the guy, a drink or two was had…
The medic turned, Hey, Troy! Perhaps the eyes
Became more focused, possibly a sign
But light did not return to the boy’s young face
And while the medic asked again the total
We all, in standing there, could see the answer:
Too much, of course, too much imbibed brings death
His friends looked to the glowing coals they hold
In blue and white the squares yield anxious words.
How long must we remain here? Responsible
we’ve been. The game will start without or with,
Must his misfortune blight our promised fun?
