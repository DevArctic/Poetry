There formed about my head is one black disc,
No blemish marks its perfect flattering face,
So infinitely thin you’ll strain to see,
And black, as black as oil, and blacker still
No ink from India nor charcoal paint
Approach the void of it, no Man on Earth
Has looked upon the darkness it contains,
The dead along the bottom sands of oceans
Are more alight than this disastrous ring.
Inside is all of nothing, all of nil.
No light, no heat or cold, no pain or joy, 
From whence we came, and where we’re headed to.
