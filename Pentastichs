What debt have I not paid in pain and fear
That might prevent my days expressed in verse?
Pray tell, what misery endured is worth 
If not conferred the right to speak and speak
The tale as understood? A Truth in sum.

***** 2 *****

I am a Man, and all that that might bring,
I bring, both faults and valors, biases,
Defects of mind and body, judgment's errs,
The leaps in logic, Good and Evil, lice
And scabs that grow, mutate or fester ooze.

***** 3 *****

I write exiled from all resounding fates
Of Fame and Fortune. I eschew my class
To work for pennies on the dollar's back,
To smile and serve the faster peoples well.
So they might do great things in place of me.

***** 4 *****

I feel as though I teeter on the brink
Of madness, like before, just short of Death!
And while the man who'd lived in my environs
Has left neglected shores of memories,
I know him not at all, and less each day.

***** 5 *****

If only They had killed me when They could!
The tragedy avoided, life could move
With haste to higher goals and lofty aims.
For I have sought to lower Men, defile
Women - if nothing else, dispense my pain.

***** 6 *****

And yet, in all the years of rampant Id,
No peace is found within my heart of hearts.
No sentence judged by God or Man exceeds
The one that I've received: To be alone.
Alone with dreams and memories of woe.

***** 7 *****

Do you think anyone remembers me?
For always are their faces dreamed,
'Just who are you?' They say, 'Yes, who is this
Who comes to me as if I know of him?'
While I begin to plead on knees and palms.

***** 8 *****

I am the Alpha! I, who once was large
And ever present in your mind, for Good
Or Ill, I loomed above your life, a cloud
Of poisoned vapors! Which, in due respect,
You'd not deserved, but that's beside the point!

***** 9 *****

Is that some wisdom or the pale uncertain
Ramblings of loss and bitterness? My friend!
I know of loss and pain, eternal Hate,
I've walked the circular enjambments, too,
And Earthly horrors lack the bite of Doom.

***** 10 *****

A writer makes a habit of obsessive moot.
This worthless spate of words I now record
Is like a brief and shining clean pavilion
Which lasts as long as nature knows it not
And soon with rain converts to vain detritus

***** 11 *****

I'd rather not involve police, today,
Nor any other, but dogs are glum when left
Without a bone to pick at, no mailmen running,
I know them well, and what a joy they take
In shocks for shocking's sake. I'm warning you.

***** 12 *****

Reflection for a dim and horrid place:
Who wields the bronze and hurried mast of law,
On ships of cast patina, swelling up
And bursting, blighted once or twice by thieves,
Defenseless now, beneath a dying Sun?

***** 13 *****

Curse Him, that made so low a creature's fate!
My heart belongs to all who will it stop,
My soul remains to carry stones from here
To there, to wonder at the large and small,
And dialogue with Him who rules the stars.

***** 14 *****

A word remarked becomes a word revered
Whose distribution falls along a line.
Bias of frailty! Tin men march a waltz,
An abacus politely changes verbs,
While all bereaved refuse to question Space.

***** 15 *****

Original or not, the dream is dead.
Through self afflicted malice, scorn might drift
The tumbled years to stricken dusts and sands,
On Greatness, heaped beliefs destroy the hands
That long to build a thing that lasts, but fail.

***** 16 *****

Violence of mind begets the thought of Shame,
And interlocking shackled forms of greed
Delight the hubris swimming off the coast.
A toast to violence out of life's desire!
Diseased it is, this long unending loss.

***** 17 *****

I dream no more of vast success in life.
For with success comes scrutinizing eyes,
Who crawl along a house's shoddy frame
And squeeze between the cracks, like icy mist,
To boast upon the world some fatal flaw.

***** 18 *****

On this, I linger for one-thousand lives.
In ignorance I stood defiantly.
A demon, no! In deed and word he knew
More Truth than he had business knowing, yet...
As simple knowledge goes, 'tis I know him now.
