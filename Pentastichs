***** 1 *****

What debt have I not paid in pain and fear
That might prevent my days expressed in verse?
Pray tell, what misery endured is worth 
If not conferred the right to speak and speak
The tale as understood? A Truth in sum.

***** 2 *****

I am a Man, and all that that might bring,
I bring, both faults and valors, biases,
Defects of mind and body, judgment's errs,
The leaps in logic, Good and Evil, lice
And scabs that grow, mutate or fester ooze.

***** 3 *****

I write exiled from all resounding fates
Of Fame and Fortune. I eschew my class
To work for pennies on the dollar's back,
To smile and serve the faster peoples well.
So they might do great things in place of me.

***** 4 *****

I feel as though I teeter on the brink
Of madness, like before, just short of Death!
And while the man who'd lived in my environs
Has left neglected shores of memories,
I know him not at all, and less each day.

***** 5 *****

If only They had killed me when They could!
The tragedy avoided, life could move
With haste to higher goals and lofty aims.
For I have sought to lower Men, defile
Women - if nothing else, dispense my pain.

***** 6 *****

And yet, in all the years of rampant Id,
No peace is found within my heart of hearts.
No sentence judged by God or Man exceeds
The one that I've received: To be alone.
Alone with dreams and memories of woe.

***** 7 *****

Do you think anyone remembers me?
For always are their faces dreamed,
'Just who are you?' They say, 'Yes, who is this
Who comes to me as if I know of him?'
While I begin to plead on knees and palms.

***** 8 *****

I am the Alpha! I, who once was large
And ever present in your mind, for Good
Or Ill, I loomed above your life, a cloud
Of poisoned vapors! Which, in due respect,
You'd not deserved, but that's beside the point!

***** 9 *****

Is that some wisdom or the pale uncertain
Ramblings of loss and bitterness? My friend!
I know of loss and pain, eternal Hate,
I've walked the circular enjambments, too,
And Earthly horrors lack the bite of Doom.

***** 10 *****

A writer makes a habit of obsessive moot.
This worthless spate of words I now record
Is like a brief and shining clean pavilion
Which lasts as long as nature knows it not
And soon with rain converts to vain detritus

***** 11 *****

I'd rather not involve police, today,
Nor any other, but dogs are glum when left
Without a bone to pick at, no mailmen running,
I know them well, and what a joy they take
In shocks for shocking's sake. I'm warning you.

***** 12 *****

Reflection for a dim and horrid place:
Who wields the bronze and hurried mast of law,
On ships of cast patina, swelling up
And bursting, blighted once or twice by thieves,
Defenseless now, beneath a dying Sun?

***** 13 *****

Curse Him, that made so low a creature's fate!
My heart belongs to all who will it stop,
My soul remains to carry stones from here
To there, to wonder at the large and small,
And dialogue with Him who rules the stars.

***** 14 *****

A word remarked becomes a word revered
Whose distribution falls along a line.
Bias of frailty! Tin men march a waltz,
An abacus politely changes verbs,
While all bereaved refuse to question Space.

***** 15 *****

Original or not, the dream is dead.
Through self afflicted malice, scorn might drift
The tumbled years to stricken dusts and sands,
On Greatness, heaped beliefs destroy the hands
That long to build a thing that lasts, but fail.

***** 16 *****

Violence of mind begets the thought of Shame,
And interlocking shackled forms of greed
Delight the hubris swimming off the coast.
A toast to violence out of life's desire!
Diseased it is, this long unending loss.

***** 17 *****

I dream no more of vast success in life.
For with success comes scrutinizing eyes,
Who crawl along a house's shoddy frame
And squeeze between the cracks, like icy mist,
To boast upon the world some fatal flaw.

***** 18 *****

On this, I linger for one-thousand lives.
In ignorance I stood defiantly.
A demon, no! In deed and word he knew
More Truth than he had business knowing, yet...
As simple knowledge goes, 'tis I know him now.

***** 19 *****

It took me years of training just to play,
And many more to stop! For what's the use
In singing songs to dismal ears of yours-
To croon above the noise of traffic sounds?
A traitor lulls himself to sleepy tones.

***** 20 *****

I'm called to work for God, Himself, divine.
Who wills in drab and unassuming rooms:
Who lives, who dies, and all the questions posed
That pass like falling leaves from prayer's end
To mail that fills up barrels cold and clean.

***** 21 *****

As planet Earth suspends the human need,
I worry not if we are all to die.
For we were doomed to die no matter what
And only in our hubris fret the end.
A spinning marble cast from metal ores.

***** 22 *****

He says, 'A woman is as woman does,
In light we find their composition, form,
In seas we taste their sandy malted glaze.
She speaks to me in phrases brought o'er leagues
From corners lesser known and lesser dreamed.'

***** 23 *****

If only I could sell my life's appeal.
To be forgotten, sunk in slimy seas!
An attribute not easily gained if lost.
I of the Great Divide. Important? No.
But left alone, too small to harm a soul.

***** 24 *****

I long believed in tales of deep, true love.
Sometimes devoted hours in search
Of Her and Her unending warm affections.
As loyal as a dog, and feminine.
Desired not a woman, but a thing.

***** 25 *****

On terrored lives she speaks of grief like sin.
Who, singing, flies the night for promised gains
And him, in lock with doom, will croon at dawn
To dance a jig for homely passersby
Without so much as limp deceased laments.

***** 26 *****

'There's Nazis everywhere,' I say to none,
'This hatred grows on cultures ripe with food,
Resists eradication like a mold
Or colony of termites, ravenous,
That chew until the wood collapses in.'

***** 27 *****

A bronze medallion hanging off her neck
And heavy that she strains to walk the road
To my abode, so shouts from 'cross the street:
'I've won! Look how the world bestows on me!'
Her echo sounds off stony forms of glass.

***** 28 *****

On Jazz, which does a man no good at all
Nor taunting children asking, 'Where's the beef?'
Brazilian models on their knees who know of flats
And fifths and sixths above the upper struct.
Whose dogs respond to frequent turnarounds.

***** 29 *****

A panicked shell permits a glowing face.
Some, called to action, rest in laurel pose,
Lampoon the notion, drowning as a frog.
As kindness comes but once a week or two,
Who dies in flaming wrecks but harbored lumps.

***** 30 *****

Now you're the Man, my man, you hold the keys
Of brash authority. You swipe ironic smiles.
The hammer falls with bright entrancing smoke
Upon the lower folks, my God, who knows!
The man who once was king of nothing lives.

***** 31 *****

I am arisen from the death of fools.
Bathed in a dark and haunting golden melt,
The needle points to me and me alone.
A gong resounds in marbled rooms of jade,
And wondrous birds take flight at my approach.

***** 32 *****

Engorge a sense of dread within the broad,
Who wanders room to room in liguored daze,
As if the world, vibrating waves in time,
Were just casino dressing, built from coin,
And stained with quarries young and old alike.

***** 33 *****

She owns contented jaws to munch on rot,
And wears the clothes that fit the bloody task.
In boiling milk she stirs ahead of rules,
Pines away gloom with handled grace of words,
And moves alike to carpenters and saints.

***** 34 *****

A toast to fumes inhaled and seas polluted.
To money's long enduring grasp on things.
To mobs! To disapproving hosts who tsk
At larger lines and fine utensil clothes.
To rocks and hills accepting crashing planes.

***** 35 *****

Though lately all has been in fun and games,
Death among joy will lift the troubled son,
Or cast him far adrift to wheat unknowns,
To diners slick with oily, greasy cues,
And finding love between the bathroom stalls.

***** 36 *****

I wrestle with temptations old and worn.
I find no newness washing out of me.
As all that can can be said must have been said
In times of legend, myth, or epic rhyme.
Some think to kill themselves! I persevere.

***** 37 *****

A scientist invents the rules of race,
Again, in mocking art, has lost a fight
That now erupts in switching furious bombs
Which press upon the issue sense of scale.
Opinions few and all agreeing, too.

***** 38 *****

Of love, I need it not, desire it less
Than brewed and shapely bubbles drifting up
Or racks of records neatly lined in shelves,
A catalog of life as vast as its
Demented subject, forced upon us all.

***** 39 *****

An elemental form containing all
Cannot exist without a flaw or two.
Nor can supremacy of language stand.
What's said in one may only work within.
I think in squares, where once I thought in bones.

***** 40 *****

Inspiring ladies topple fast when asked:
Do all your sins of balance and delight
Cross deserts topped with gales of impious rage
Where figures run the gauntlet clothed in red,
Or have your arms been sundered free of you?

***** 41 *****

I am a man of many varied wounds.
Distressed as I may seem, my friend, fear not,
It is a farce, this arbitrary life,
One's role may be to play the gestured fool
Who cleans the brush from floors of forests dark.

***** 42 *****

Beliefs make easy slough in times of need.
The better coals might smolder hot for for days,
Or taste of pork and salt when eaten raw,
While others cook your skin, make poison earth,
And cause the house to sway in creaking fear.
