What use are you to me? We are not friends.
I have no friends, and don’t desire them.
I don’t expect a thing from you but lies.
What else is there to say? Begone from here,
And take your infantile emotions, too.
No pity do I feel, no pity, none.
And she departs at once without a word. 
I nurse a beer, and drink in gulps of rage.
My fury bleeds and raises up disdain,
Now blame begins to form in my sick mind,
By virtue of her Womanhood she holds
The key to her mistreatment. Neither I
Nor any other Man on Earth bear fault
When Women move to spurn their lovers, No,
‘Tis I who’s blameless, here, and I will die
Before the truth of things is squashed away.
Walk on, young Woman, say what you will say!
You’ve met with one who knows the truth of noise.
I’ll see you suffocate in static, friend,
Before I ply with humble tones, Forgive
Poor me! I’ve done you wrong! Oh boo hoo hoo!
That weakness you will never siphon out,
As I remain enshrined in love of self,
New questions shall arise about the date.
Why were you there if not for what he thought?
A Man is Man -- and Man is of one mind.
Naive, if not malevolent in deed,
Just think, sad boyfriend all alone at work,
Sees you shacked up with me, for shame, young girl,
What righteousness could come in these few facts?
Now I will drink to that! My conscience clear,
And not a nagging doubt engulfs my mind,
But if such doubt exists, I’ll drown it soon,
Move on from self-ablation, take up arms
Against a sea of troubles, drink, friend, drink.
