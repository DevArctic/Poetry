'Will you still call from large and ominous deeds,
To speak with me? The small and grounded rodent,
To your ambitious avian appetite?
I think I will become too scarce a meal,
And wonder when you'll find the time to pause,
Between your flashy songs and patchwork art
An artist's love is first his own creations.
There won't be room for me, not if I still
Eat as I've done. My stomach grows too round
My thighs too thick. I'll beg for space within
Your heart and beg for more than I can say.
I'm not a beggar. I have half a mind
To leave it here and never speak again.
Why all this doom and gloom? Tomorrow's pain
Is lofty needles, today's is mostly sour.
I fret that I'm confused and barely sensed.
If we were born one hundred years ago,
I might implore you write on stationary
I'd wait on hands and knees for daily rounds
an old decrepit man in shorts and socks
With bags of mail, and wistfully he'd say
No, not today, poor girl. And converse with others,
That poor, poor girl, who waits and waits for mail,
From who? They'd ask, so curious of me,
THe young and pretty woman wasting years
On far away distractions, a man, he'd say
Who left from here a long long time ago,
ANd promised her he'd write her songs and sonnets,
So still she waits for him as she had pledged.
What a sad pathetic creature I've become!
Meanwhile my youth and beauty drift to sea
My garden blooms with all the suitors' gifts
But all denied for love of him that left.
I hardly think it just or seemly. You?
Don't speak. I must now bear these woes alone.
Immobile rust which moves in sudden starts.
When you return, the water might flow up.
