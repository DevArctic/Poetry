My friend, the things that I have done for love!
Or not for love, but I know not what else
might drive a man down such destructive roads
Would she have been replaced by someone else,
And all of time rewound, to this rued spot,
What diffâ€™rence might be made, my life renewed
For all of my regrets defer to her.
