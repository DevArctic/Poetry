A word of warning, there are violent descriptions.
**************************************************





Poisonous minds inhabit smaller pools,
If fish were all benign the world would not
be ruled as good, or having justice, fair,
I wished at once to leap from my confined
morality and stab the man nearby
inside the eyes, perhaps, and gouge them out
And hold them up so all might heed my words.
Such violence ought to be in use of something,
But really I had merely transferred rage
From subject to subject, woman to man in shorts,
Whom sat in menacing pose; whom lived imprisoned
within his own desire, (though I was young
And hardly noticed things beyond their signs)
whom was trapped together with the troubled youth
in silent clicking sanity and power games.
'Hey you!' he called to me. 'Get back to work!'
Like some bedeviled ranger riding past
A gang and cocking a standard issue shotgun 
he barked in the angry confidence of hate
that makes a mole of Man and Child alike.
What use was in rebellion? Now or Then?
For my young insolence I suffered now,
And having rightly pointed out absurd
Moronic myths of magical leprosy, I,
Stood accused and now condemned to waste a day,
to sit and think on my transgressions here
In a brightly lit communal dungeon room.
My company is said lobotomized enforcer,
And two of my sad peers, of crimes unknown,
Though surely, most assuredly, as bland
As mine and meaning even less than that.
'What difference does it make?' I'd said to her,
'Identified or not my body bleeds
The same, has all the same inside of it.
Am I some wayward youth who's wandered in?
Distracted by the shoddy cinderblock?
Do I belong to this demented body
That you might call a school or am I lost?
Your efforts fail to reach the shore of reason,
Your sense of safety dims your mind to darkness,
You might control the coffee in your mug
Or then again you might lose sight of it
And wonder whence the taste of spittle comes
When all you'd known before was cocoa milk.
I don't subscribe to your ideas or notions.
I live above your goals, and always have.
To wear or not to wear this placard visage
Has no importance save the broken will
Of meeting imagined murder with bureaucracy!
Be gone from me! I see beyond your sight!'
For this they clapped me in the schoolhouse jail.
