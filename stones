a harbinger of doom, of restless toil,
of monks in houses hung from tops of trees,
I played the game when I was young, with vigor
And a slowing sense of tiresome family duty.
I loved the loamy clay which clumped together |
and ground-up chalk from base to dirty base.
Still, today I moan in ecstasy
At lines and rakes that drag across an infield
Which wipe the slate for innings bagged and played.
As if a dirty field were like a room.
