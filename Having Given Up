ringing boxes mirrored faces
seeking out more shoddy places
I miss my friend he died so young
silver slicing splitted tongues
looking up the prognosis tables
proportion of the dead enabled
narcan santas, veins of ore
crying mothers hoarding lore
television message seen
heâ€™s going to die we all agree
