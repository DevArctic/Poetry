I have been struck by visions once before,
The kinds of scenes brought out in colored wishing
where characters and plots unfold anew
and landscapes match the power of artful words,
O - I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.
It feels as though I've tapped a magic pipe
And siphoned out a small delicious gulp
From worlds of broadened and evolving physics
Worlds unrestrained by Newton's laws, by science,
by heavy and articulate turns of phrase,
Or sense as we now know it made, alas,
My mutterings appear as schizophrenic jabs,
Make me a fool in eyes so blind to all
That lives or dies in ignorance and pain.
One's role may be to play the gestured fool,
Who sweeps the brush from 'twixt the bricklaid buildings
Is that my lot, my place and destined part?
I ask of Him above, my great promoter,
Who answers not, as is his normal route.
Well, be it so, my place is here below,
To wandering campus as a troll of art
As filthy as his mind, as lost as found,
Believing less and less of good and goodness.

I never paid for my transgressive acts,
Not once was I paraded, shackled, bound
As many might have wished for, more or less…
Instead I crashed from Place to Place, askew
And shouting out obscenities at night
In hopes that stern authority came calling,
‘Be quiet, for God and Country, cease this noise!
Good people must be let to sleep, and you,
You horrid thing, what pit produced these lungs
Which cry in search of meaning, depth and joy?’
